  {
    question: "What is a Dutch auction?",
    answer: "Dutch Auctions are a centuries old system, aimed at finding the true market value of a completely novel item. In the case of MISO token auctions, the price is set at a higher value per token than expected and descends over time, with the eventual price being settled on once all tokens have been sold. Practically, this means participants individually decide at which point they're happy with a token price and commit their funds. Through this mechanism, the total end value of our public sale is not known until the auction sales are fully completed.",

    question: "Will there be liquidity following the token launch?",

In this way this pool will become our long-term liquidity venue.`,

    `Suspended Soul made its blockchain debut at the height of the NFT revolution. With the firm conviction of being protagonists of a historic paradigm shift in the way art is created, shared and collected, as founders of Suspended Soul we decided to offer the community a boutique alternative in a market overloaded with volume. Each artist leaves their soul in their work. Suspended Soul came to honor that creative act.`,
    `One auction at a time. No overlapping, no multiple bidding. Exclusive and total exposure for each work. For each artist behind their work. For every soul.`

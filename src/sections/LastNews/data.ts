    title: 'THE SOULX SITE APPLIED FOR THE AWWWARDS 2021',
    description: `The new and acclaimed SOULX project applied with its landing page for the awwwards 2021. Awwwards are the Website Awards that recognize and promote the talent and effort of the leading thinkers in tech & digital talent on design, creativity and innovation on the Internet. Our team has been working passionately on this website, which represents a big leap into our project’s new phase: a digital space where we all poured our hearts and souls into, created solely for the community to dive deep into and get to know us better. Transparency and fairness are our core values, and that is why we want to share our roadmap with all of you. Suspended SOUL's developers, graphic designers and creative copywriters, led by the creative, marketing and operative directors, are the great minds behind this major step, and it would be a dream to have this collective creation recognized by such a prestigious award.`,

    title: `SUSPENDED SOUL AT DECENTRALAND`,
    description: `Suspended Soul bought a land parcel on Decentraland, the first-ever virtual world owned by its users, with the aim of building the first boutique NFT gallery’s Auction House inside the metaverse. Decentraland is the first fully decentralized world, controlled via the DAO, which owns its most important smart contracts and assets. In that way, you decide and vote on how the world works. Having turned a blank canvas into such an avant-garde and community oriented project is a dream come true for all the core team of Suspended SOUL. A new chapter is unfolding, and we want our community to take center stage: this is another big step towards the decentralization model we have been envisioning since the beginning stages of this project, and we are more than pleased that you can take part in it and interact with our ecosystem in this groundbreaking way. Stay tuned! This is only the beginning.`,

Our token sales will distribute 10% of the total supply through a Dutch auction via https://miso.sushi.com/. A Dutch auction is a type of auction in which the token's starting price is launched higher, and starts decreasing with time. The eventual price offered is determined once all the tokens are sold. What do you need to know to get ready?`,

The Community Treasury will be owned and managed by $SOULYx holders once the Suspended Soul DAO is developed. While in itâ€™s beginning stages, it will be moderated by the Suspended Soul Foundation, keeping as its main goals the development of immersive experiences, and the encouragement of emerging artistic endeavour (patronage), putting into motion subvention projects for emerging artist's with a promising future.
